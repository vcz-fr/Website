## Abilities

Technologically speaking, I am agnostic. I don't believe in one universally best technology stack. Fundamentally, the
underlying design processes are similar so rejecting some technology based on hype, age or for being proprietary would
not make a lot of sense. Technology is a tool to reach a business outcome and some tools are more efficient, that's all.

### The human

I am:
- Very open to many topics;
- Extrovert but not a party person;
- Calm and collected;
- Ambitious. Very.

Want to become:
- Socially responsible;
- A world changer, don't we all?

Though, I am also:
- Expressive but not talkative;
- Easily bored when not challenged.

### The other stuff

I enjoy trying new things and experimenting, it helps me thinking out of the box. Being creative is really important when
dealing with issues almost nobody faced before. I'm obviously not limiting myself to new technologies.

I strongly believe in minimalism: reducing the amount of data that gets collected, processed, stored, sent over. Leading
to lower costs of maintenance and operation, and general satisfaction. I could not optimize this website further with
the current extent of my knowledge.

This belief translates into strong advocacy for privacy. Tracking users is bad: you would not follow someone on the
street to know their habits, right?

Other than that, I love trying new places, I do my share of physical activity including climbing and I spend way too
much time gushing about the latest tech breakthroughs.

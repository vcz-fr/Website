## Abilities

Technologically speaking, I am agnostic. I don't believe in one universally best technology stack. Fundamentally, the
underlying design processes are similar so it would not make sense to reject some because they contain noisy, old-school
or proprietary elements.

### The human

I think I am:
- Extrovert but not a party person;
- Calm and collected;
- Ambitious but moderate;
- A crazy fast learner.

Want to become:
- Socially responsible;
- A world changer

Though, I am also:
- Expressive but not talkative;
- Easily bored when not challenged

### The other stuff

I love trying new things and experimenting, it helps me thinking out of the box. Being creative is really important when
dealing with issues almost nobody faced before. I'm obviously not limiting myself to new technologies.

Quite frankly, I love going out for new experiences as much as I fancy watching movies and series, meeting new faces and
sharing my knowledge.

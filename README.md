The current version of my personal website, out in the open!

## The motivation
My website has to represent my ideal in terms of engineering. I love fast websites that respect standards as much as I love experimenting with stuff online. Every now and then, I want to tackle new challenges, like "open sourcing" my website, using a website generator and yes, hosting it for free.

Every iteration adds new ideas and features to the mix like a cleaner design, performance, personnality. This one will allow me to integrate some features and keep experimenting while keeping some key ideas that have already been developed and thoroughly thought about.

## About forking this repo to create a personal website
Yes, of course you can! If you like it, you are even encouraged to do so. Please do me two favors:
- Share your ideas by leaving your thoughts in an issue. I will gladly come back to you as soon as I can;
- Read the code, just in case some ugly monster is laying around.

## History, reversed

### v6 (current) - Open
Similar in terms of design, this new version uses [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and its static website generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This allows the website to be very lightweight by avoiding most of the hacks of the previous version, generating the sitemap, the robots.txt file and with a layout fit for more resolutions. In addition, the code is open to everyone and changes can be made much faster!

### v5 - Parallelogram
The reference. Very lightweight, no JavaScript, represented my fight for extreme performance and backed by a CDN. Made in one inspired afternoon using some trending technologies, this website does not aim to support older browsers.

Feature-wise, it only contains what is absolutely necessary to run it and uses hacks to propose a navigation or defer image loading.

Like the previous versions, this website does not posess a backend, making evolutions kind of difficult but not immensely... until the website has been hand-optimized.

### v4 - HTML5 UP
One of the longest standing versions. Classic when it comes to personal websites. The design originated from HTML5 UP and solved much of the issues encountered with the previous versions.

Nevertheless, all that comes at a shocking price: the sheer number of dependencies to download and apply made this website heavy. I had to strip features down to the acceptable minimum. Moreover, the contents and the design were very difficult to change.

### v3 - FlatUI
More a style update than an actual new version. This website was the first and last to contain a backend that allowed to manage some of the contents that were presented on the website.

However, the website design prevented its support by devices with smaller viewports, even though Bootstrap 3 with a custom UI was used.

The colors were very bright and all over the place. This changed over time.

### v2 - Portal
The first standalone personal website, with links to other creations. The design was very basic and consisted of graphic elements of a game that I enjoyed playing at that time: Portal.

Nevertheless, the site was quite poor in terms of contents.

### v1 - Alphorm
My first website ever, hosted on a .tk domain and a free web host. Both are now gone, for the sake of humanity.

The "About me" page of that website contained a quick presentation as the website focused on two creations:
- CodeX: a game where players would solve very unbalanced and difficult enigmas;
- Xoop: a cooperative game where everyone was progressing on the same levels with a semi-social experience with achievements and a point system based on their contributions.

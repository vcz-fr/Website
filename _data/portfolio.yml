    I've grown this project from design to dogfooding then commercialization. It collects and presents massive amounts
    of near real-time sensor data for industrial applications. I designed its first implementation, the first ecosystem
    components, all with performance and usability in mind. It could overload the time series vendor without breaking a
    sweat!

    A friend of a friend had their Wordpress hacked and were panicking because of that. I proposed to redevelop the
    whole website in a way that prevents any hacking from happening ever again; statically generated. This happened over
    the course of a week based on their old design, just before their sales season began.

    This small community needed a website to store their game rules and assets and I wanted to help. This is why I
    prototyped this website in a week. The goal would be to grow it into a platform for the web games the community
    develops and a more social space that extends their community and reaches out.

    Like VCZ Apps, this is a way to express my creativity and share my thoughts in written form. It gets less attention
    because it requires me a lot of focus and consistently being in the same mood. Moving out of a full-fledged blogging
    platform like Medium was the best decision I made, I cannot recommend it enough.

    This site contains the notes transcribed from local meetups with some research and more options for readers such as
    a link to the video, slides, a reading time estimate and a table of contents. The minimalistic interface reduces
    distractions.

    Sometimes, you come across an article and you get this weird idea you have to prototype. Sometimes the prototype
    works. That's how this website came into existence. I am not planning on adding too many apps though, there are
    better websites out there!

    2015-2022 version of the ENSEIRB-MATMECA Arts Club website. Before my intervention, it contained bits of HTML to do
    the job. I have been pulled in to write some PHP and take design and content cues from what I knew from the web at
    the time.

            Again, thank you for the time you have spent discovering this website.
            Did you know that it only uses HTML and CSS for everything?
            Yes, that's right, no JS or back-end technology involved! Everything is static!

            Anyway, if you want to find out more, here are my English and French resumes.
            Don't forget to come see me on my social networks!

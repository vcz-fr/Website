    <p>
        Again, thank you for the time you have spent discovering this website.
        Did you know that it only uses HTML and CSS for everything?
        Yes, that's right, no JS or back-end technology involved! Everything is static!
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, if you want to find out more, here are my English and French resumes.
        Don't forget to come see me on my social networks!
    </p>

{% for item in site.data.resume %}
<div class="card">
    <h3>{{item.language}}</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="/assets/resume/{{item.file}}">Link</a>
        &mdash; {{item.size}}KB, last modified {{item.last-modified | date: "%m/%d/%Y"}}

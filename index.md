## About me

Hello, Vincenzo **Scalzi** here!

I am a passionate web engineer that experimented with all sorts of web technologies and always in search for more ideas.
_In performance I trust._

It is one of my duties to help deliver what the community considers best in terms of product quality by actively
participating in the creation of product and development standards and by enabling a company-wide sharing of knowledge
while solving some of the most challenging issues of today.

I highly value the people around me and their time and strive to make myself replaceable or useless. My satisfaction
comes from when my customers are delighted by the work and when they gain in autonomy and technical knowledge.

Apart from that, I spend time tweaking infrastructure, internal platforms, sharing knowledge with peers and maintainers
and organizing our technological ecosystem including introducing tools and services and scouting for ideas that matter.

When I am not behind my desk, I read from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/){:rel="nofollow"}, join tech
meetups, share my [meetup notes](https://github.com/vcz-fr/meetup-notes){:rel="nofollow"}, explore ideas and enjoy my
time!

***

I currently work as a **Senior Cloud & DevOps Engineer** at [**Gekko Part of Accenture**](https://www.gekko.fr){:rel="nofollow"}.
I specialize in serverless architectures, DevOps philosophy and web engineering with some content creation here and
there. All of that with AWS. My customers choose me for my development background, whih is quite rare in Cloud-centric
companies.

Before that, I was in [**Moonda**](https://moonda.com/){:rel="nofollow"} as a Fullstack Developer. It is a web agency
based in Bordeaux using [eZPublish](https://ez.no/){:rel="nofollow"}, a PHP-based Content Management System. There, I
helped migrate a massive project from OVHCloud to AWS, created and directed the creation of new ecosystem components, optimized spend and made development and deployment a bit more bearable.

I have been a Computer Science Engineering student at [**Bordeaux Graduate School of Engineering**](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/){:rel="nofollow"}
a.k.a. **ENSEIRB-MATMECA**. I chose the Multimedia and Video games specialty there, mostly to open myself to new ideas.

If you ever need help with a web project or want to learn a few things, let's have a chat!

Have a nice visit!

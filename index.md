## About me

Hello, I'm Vincenzo **Scalzi** and this is my corner of the Web!

I love the Web and the gems that it contains, the inspiration and the technology. I am omni-curious, a technologist and
like to share through my [notes](https://github.com/vcz-fr/meetup-notes){:rel="nofollow"}, at meetups and with my
co-workers!

Technology has reached a point where it could serve us better by giving us space to grow. I fully embrace this by using
my time online to learn, notably from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/){:rel="nofollow"}, contribute new
knowledge or find new ways to reduce my impact. High performance does correlate with minimalism, sustainability and
smaller costs of operation and maintenance!

At work, I help deliver best-in-class solutions either myself or with the help of fantastic people that I raise the bar
with. I swing new ideas and tools around and observe how they accelerate us and save precious time or mental load.

I highly value surrounding people, their time and strive to make myself replaceable. My work is truly complete when my
customers are delighted and when they achieve full autonomy and technical sharpness.

Finally, I enjoy my time: playing the ukulele, organizing travels, eating out, walking around aimlessly, playing
timeless video-games, reading, learning. You know the stuff.

## Get in touch!

Find me through LinkedIn and send me a message! If you've got business, wish to learn stuff with me or just for a chat,
go ahead. I'm open to discussion, even about those things people are usually shy about.

## About my work

And if you're here to learn about my journey, here you go:

- **Cloud Architect, DevOps & SRE Lead** at [Pyl.Tech](https://pyl.tech/){:rel="nofollow"}  
  I help our customers better understand the Cloud, the tooling and the piping, whether it's GCP, AWS or Azure! I also
  organize events, write contents like LinkedIn, blog posts and [a public newsletter](https://buttondown.com/pylote){:rel="nofollow"} and contribute things I'm not allowed to talk about ;)

- **Cloud Architect** at [SOPHiA Genetics](https://www.sophiagenetics.com/){:rel="nofollow"}  
  I turbocharged the team that accelerates tech teams; DevOps. By introducing missing practices and a different way of
  working. Commit conventions, release automation, foundational Cloud layers automation, simplifying infrastructure and
  CI/CD, etc. It's not just tech and that's what is refreshing about it!

- **Senior Cloud & DevOps Engineer** at **Gekko Part of Accenture**  
  Serverless architectures on AWS, DevOps philosophy and Web engineering. My development background was what sold it for
  my customers, for whom I delivered optimizations in their critical energy systems, linear TV advertising platform,
  insurance and real estate IT services and so on. This company taught me the value of the Cloud and how to create
  sustainable and performant services. And documentation, and how to effectively introduce new ideas to customers and
  conduct them to fruition and beyond.

- **Fullstack Developer** at **Moonda**  
  A now defunct web agency based using the now deprecated PHP Content Management System _eZPublish_ to develop
  dealership website generators for John Deere, Yale and other customers. I migrated that product from OVHCloud to AWS,
  maintained it, added Cloudflare and developed new components in PHP and Angular. The rest was about introducing better
  practices around CI/CD, using GitLab to its fullest, tooling and infrastructure.

Have a nice visit and a nice day!

## About me

Hello, I'm Vincenzo **Scalzi** and this is my personal corner of the Web!

I love the Web and the gems that it contains, the inspiration and the technology. I am very passionate about technology
and like to share this through my [notes](https://github.com/vcz-fr/meetup-notes){:rel="nofollow"}, at meetups and with
my co-workers!

Technology has reached a point where it could serve us better by giving us space to grow. I fully embrace this by using
my time online to learn new facts, notably from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/){:rel="nofollow"},
contribute new knowledge or find new ways to reduce my impact. High performance does correlate with minimalism,
sustainability and smaller costs of operation and maintenance!

At work, I help deliver best-in-class solutions either myself or with the help of fantastic people that I only encourage
to do better with better tooling. I like spreading shiny new ideas and tools around and seeing them accelerating us and
saving precious time or mental load.

I highly value the people around me and their time and strive to make myself replaceable or useless. My work is truly
complete when my customers are delighted by the work and when they achieve full autonomy and technical know-how.

Finally, I also like to enjoy my time: playing the ukulele, organizing my travels, eating out, walking around aimlessly,
playing timeless video-games, reading, learning. You know, the usual stuff.

## Get in touch!

Find my through LinkedIn and send me a message! I will not put my email address on this website for obvious scraping
reasons! If you've got business, wish to learn stuff with me or just for a chat, go ahead. I'm open to discussion, even
about those things people are usually shy about.

## About my work

And if you're here to learn about my journey, here you go:

- **Cloud Architect** at [SOPHiA Genetics](https://www.sophiagenetics.com/){:rel="nofollow"}  
  I initially accelerated the team that accelerates all tech teams; DevOps. Not by being a lead but by solving pain
  points. Introducing missing practices like commit messages, automating releases, automating foundational Cloud layers,
  opening the door to more complex infrastructure and CI/CD, more complex releases, communication practices, etc. But
  it's not only tech: steering the team towards a more sustainable framework, one that involves less firefighting and
  more building the product.

- **Senior Cloud & DevOps Engineer** at **Gekko Part of Accenture**.  
  Serverless architectures on AWS, DevOps philosophy and Web engineering. My development background was what sold my
  customers, for whom I delivered optimizations in their critical energy systems, linear TV advertising platform,
  insurance and real estate IT services and so on. This company taught me the value of the Cloud and how to create
  sustainable and performant services. And documentation, and how to effectively introduce new ideas to customers and
  conduct them to fruition and beyond.

- **Fullstack Developer** at **Moonda**.  
  A now defunct web agency based using an ancient PHP Content Management System called eZPublish to develop dealership
  website generators for John Deere, Yale and other customers. I migrated that product from OVHCloud to AWS, maintained
  it, added Cloudflare and developed new components in PHP and Angular. The rest was about introducing better practices
  around CI/CD, using GitLab to its fullest, tooling and infrastructure.

Have a nice visit and a nice day!

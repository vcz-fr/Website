## About me

Hello, I'm Vincenzo **Scalzi** and welcome to my corner of the Web!

I love the Web and the gems it contains, the inspiration and the technologies and people that shape it. I am curious
about everything, a technologist and like to share through my [notes](https://meetups.vcz.fr/), [my newsletter](https://buttondown.com/pylote){:rel="nofollow"},
at meetups, [my slides](https://vcz.fr/slides) and with my co-workers, friends, family, network and so on!

Technology has reached a point where it serves us better by giving us space to grow. I fully embrace this by using
my time online to research and learn, notably from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/){:rel="nofollow"},
contribute new knowledge or find new ways to optimize my contributions. High performance can correlate with minimalism,
sustainability and ease of operation and maintenance!

At work, I help deliver best-in-class solutions with the help of brilliant people that I raise the proverbial bar with.
I swing new ideas and tools around and observe how they accelerate and liberate systems, people and processes. It
happens that I also help with knowledge sharing and systems administration when I have a minute to spare at work. The
objective being to empower my company to do its best job even if it require contributing hours here and there.

I highly value surrounding people, their time and strive to make them empowered and myself replaceable. My work is truly
complete when my customers are delighted and when they achieve full autonomy and technical sharpness. It contributed to
spinning out [a company](https://www.terega-solutions.fr/en){:rel="nofollow"} from thin air, a feat I cannot stop
gushing about years after —although I definitely should!

Finally, I enjoy my time: playing the ukulele, organizing travels, eating out, walking around aimlessly, playing
timeless video-games, reading, writing, learning. It seems I have somehow discovered a rift through spacetime that
enables me to do and genuinely enjoy all that. Pretty awesome if you ask me!

## Get in touch!

Find me through LinkedIn and send me a message! If you've got business, wish to learn stuff with me or just for a chat,
go ahead. I'm open to discussion, even about those things people are usually shy about. I am also open to mentor people
and help our industry grow to a better place —as long as this message is present on this website, which it is right
now.

## About my work

And if you're here to learn about my journey, here you go:

- **Cloud Architect, DevOps & SRE Lead** at [Pyl.Tech](https://pyl.tech/){:rel="nofollow"}  
  I help our customers better understand the Cloud, the tooling and the piping! I also organize events, write contents
  on LinkedIn, blog posts and [a public newsletter](https://buttondown.com/pylote){:rel="nofollow"} and contribute
  things I'm not allowed to talk about ;)

- **Cloud Architect** at [SOPHiA Genetics](https://www.sophiagenetics.com/){:rel="nofollow"}  
  I turbocharged the team that accelerates tech teams; DevOps. By introducing missing practices and a different way of
  working. Commit conventions, release automation, foundational Cloud layers automation, simplifying infrastructure and
  CI/CD, etc. It's not just tech and that's what is refreshing about it!

- **Senior Cloud & DevOps Engineer** at **Gekko Part of Accenture**  
  Serverless architectures on AWS, DevOps philosophy and Web engineering. My development background was what sold it for
  my customers, for whom I delivered optimizations in their critical energy systems, linear TV advertising platform,
  insurance and real estate IT services and so on. This company taught me the value of the Cloud and how to create
  sustainable and performant services. And documentation, and how to effectively introduce new ideas to customers and
  conduct them to fruition and beyond.

- **Fullstack Developer** at **Moonda**  
  A now defunct web agency based using the now deprecated PHP Content Management System _eZPublish_ to develop
  dealership website generators for John Deere, Yale and other customers. I migrated that product from OVHCloud to AWS,
  maintained it, added Cloudflare and developed new components in PHP and Angular. The rest was about introducing better
  practices around CI/CD, using GitLab to its fullest, tooling and infrastructure.

Have a nice visit and a nice day!

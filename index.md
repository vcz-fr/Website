## About me

Hello, Vincenzo **Scalzi** here!

I am a passionate web engineer that experimented with all sorts of web technologies and always in search for more ideas.
_In performance I trust._

It is one of my duties to help deliver what the community considers best in terms of product quality by actively
participating in the creation of product and development standards and by enabling a company-wide sharing of knowledge
while solving some of the most challenging issues of today.

I highly value the people around me and their time and strive to make myself replaceable or useless. My satisfaction
comes from when my customers are delighted by the work and when they gain in autonomy and technical know-how.

Apart from that I spend time tweaking infrastructure, internal platforms, sharing with peers and organizing our
ecosystems including introducing tools and services and scouting for ideas that matter.

When I am not behind my desk, I read from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/){:rel="nofollow"}, join tech
meetups, share my [notes](https://github.com/vcz-fr/meetup-notes){:rel="nofollow"}, explore ideas and enjoy my time!

***

My experiences include:

- **Senior Cloud & DevOps Engineer** at [**Gekko Part of Accenture**](https://www.gekko.fr){:rel="nofollow"}. I
  specialized in Serverless architectures, DevOps philosophy and web engineering. My customers chose me for my
  development background, which is infrequent in Cloud-centric companies.

- **Fullstack Developer** at [**Moonda**](https://moonda.com/){:rel="nofollow"}. A web agency based in Bordeaux using [eZPublish](https://ez.no/){:rel="nofollow"},
  a PHP-based Content Management System. I migrated a product from OVHCloud to AWS, designed and led the creation of new
  ecosystem components, optimized spend and made development and deployment a bit more bearable.

I have studied Computer Science Engineering at [**Bordeaux Graduate School of Engineering**](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/){:rel="nofollow"}
a.k.a. **ENSEIRB-MATMECA**.

If you need help with a web project or want to learn a few things, let's have a chat!

Have a nice visit!

## The slide archive room

When introducing new concepts around, visual explainers in the form of slides are among the best suited to get ideas
through. This is a collection of slides that have been archived from my Slides.com account, where the free plan limits
me to 10 slides and not one more.

If you have seen them live, you might feel like they are slightly different. This is normal as there are slight
differences between the open source version of the framework and the SaaS. An example of this difference is that the
slides should be significantly faster to load, but they're missing a lot of features including the presenter notes. At
least they will be here for as long as this website and its archived version exists.

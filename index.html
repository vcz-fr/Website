    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, Vincenzo <b>Scalzi</b> here!</p>
    <p>
        I am a passionate web engineer and a front / back hybrid. <em>In performance I trust.</em></p>
    <p>
        I currently work at <a href="https://moonda.com/"><strong>Moonda</strong></a> as a full-stack developer.
        It is a web agency based in Bordeaux using <a href="https://ez.no/">eZPublish </a> and
        <a href="https://ezplatform.com/">eZPlatform</a>, Content Management Systems based on PHP and Symfony.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also one of my duties to help deliver what our team considers best in terms of product
        quality by actively participating in the creation of our integration and delivery pipeline,
        quality assurance, coding standards and by allowing a company-wide sharing of knowledge while
        solving some of the most challenging issues when maintaining <s>dark magic</s> undocumented
        legacy code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before that, I was in <a href="https://privalia.com/"> <strong>Privalia</strong></a>, a Spanish fashion
        outlet, as a full-stack developer in their <strong>Performance & Core Platform</strong> team. I was
        in charge of a project that automatically checks the performance of their platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been a Computer Science Engineering student at
        <a href="https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr"><strong>Bordeaux Graduate School of Engineering</strong></a> or
        <strong>ENSEIRB-MATMECA</strong>, for short.
        I chose the Multimedia and Video games specialty there, mostly to open myself to new ideas.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, Vincenzo <b>Scalzi</b> here!
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a passionate web engineer that experimented with all sorts of web technologies and always in search
        for more ideas. <em>In performance I trust.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is one of my duties to help deliver what we consider best in terms of product quality by
        actively participating in the creation of integration and delivery pipelines, quality assurance,
        product standards and by enabling a company-wide sharing of knowledge while solving some of the most
        challenging issues of today.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from that, I spend time tweaking infrastructure, internal platforms, sharing knowledge
        with peers and maintainers and organizing our technological ecosystem including introducing tools
        and services and scouting for ideas thay may or may not impact our business.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I am not behind my desk, I read from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">Hacker News</a>,
        join tech meetups, share my <a href="https://github.com/vcz-fr/meetup-notes">meetup notes</a>,
        explore ideas and enjoy my time!
    </p>

        I currently work as a <strong>Cloud & DevOps Engineer</strong> at <a href="https://www.gekko.fr"><strong>Gekko Part of Accenture</strong></a>.
        The goal of our company is to make the Cloud accessible and a stepping stone to richer experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before that, I was in <a href="https://moonda.com/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Moonda</strong></a> as a full-stack developer.
        It is a web agency based in Bordeaux using <a href="https://ez.no/" rel="nofollow">eZPublish</a>, a PHP-based Content Management System.
        They also create their own products and platforms using edge technologies and practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been a Computer Science Engineering student at
        <a href="https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Bordeaux Graduate School of Engineering</strong></a> or
        <strong>ENSEIRB-MATMECA</strong>, for short. I chose the Multimedia and Video games specialty there,
        mostly to open myself to new ideas.
